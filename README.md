# PromptingNemo
PromptingNemo is a toolkit for fine-tuning end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, integrating both audio-visual and speech-only models. 

## Speech-2-Action

Focus on this repository for Speech-2-Action models, built by innovaiton and research over pretrained audio and visual encoders.

These models process streamed audio or video input and output streamed tokens. Tokens are either:
1. What you speak (standard transcription)
2. Infered TAGS

For the sample modles we provide, TAGS infered from the context belong to multi-modal language and tonal understanding, visualQA and voice biometrics. 

We provides tools for exporting Nemo models to ONNX and Hugging Face formats.

Also checkout our applications on sample usage of Speech-2-Action models


## Setting up

### Using Docker

Use pre-built docker
``` 
docker pull WhissleAI:nemo:latest
```
Build docker from WhissleAI's Nemo branch
```
add docker commands
```

### 📹 Pretrained Models

Currently, we provide models capable of tagging different tokens while transcribing.

| Model Name            | Token-type                          | #hrs    | HF-link                                                 |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Speech-Tagger-EN-NER-EMOTION | Named Entities, Emotions, Roles | 2500    | [BERT Base](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased)    |
| Cnformer-CTC          | Named Entities, Emotions            | 1000    | [BERT Base](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased)    |
| Cnformer-CTC          | Named Entities, Emotions (5 languages) | CommonVoice | [BERT Base](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased) |


## Usage

To use these pretrained models, follow the instructions provided in the source links. Typically, you'll need to install specific libraries or frameworks, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or the Hugging Face Transformers library.

For example, to use the BERT Base model from Hugging Face, you can do the following in Python:

```python
import nemo.collections.asr as nemo_asr
asr_model = nemo_asr.models.ASRModel.from_pretrained("WhissleAI/stt_en_conformer_ctc_digits")

transcriptions = asr_model.transcribe(["file.wav"])
```
