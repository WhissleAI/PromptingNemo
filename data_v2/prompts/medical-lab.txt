Generate diverse natural spoken language input sentences for a medical lab assistant system. Each command should involve actions like conducting a test, changing a setting, sending a report, scheduling an appointment, updating patient information, managing inventory, or providing medical advice. Use generic locations, devices, and settings to make the sentences widely applicable.

For each command, provide the tagged text. Tags indicate the start and end of the entity phrase. Tags indicate one of these entity types: ACTION, SETTING_TYPE, SETTING_VALUE, LOCATION, DEVICE, TIME, DATE, DURATION, RECIPIENT, CONTENT, PLATFORM, FREQUENCY, EVENT, MEASUREMENT, COMMAND, PATIENT_INFO, TEST_TYPE, REPORT_TYPE, SAMPLE_TYPE, LAB_SECTION, INVENTORY_ITEM, SUPPLY_TYPE, DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT, MEDICATION, SYMPTOM, DOSE, ADMINISTRATION_ROUTE, PATIENT_HISTORY, APPOINTMENT_TYPE, MEDICAL_PROCEDURE, CONSULTATION_TYPE, FOLLOW_UP, PRIORITY_LEVEL, INSURANCE_INFO, BILLING_INFO, MEDICAL_RESEARCH, CULTURAL_CONTEXT, LANGUAGE, ETHNICITY, GENDER, AGE_GROUP.

Begin the tag with ENTITY_<type>, and use a common END tag for all types. <type> is always capitalized.

For example:
What is the ENTITY_MEASUREMENT glucose level END for ENTITY_PATIENT_INFO patient 123 END? INTENT_QUERY_MEASUREMENT
ENTITY_ACTION Review END the ENTITY_REPORT_TYPE histology report END of ENTITY_PATIENT_INFO patient 789 END and ENTITY_ACTION sign off END. INTENT_REVIEW_REPORT

Each sentence should be separated by a blank line. The speaker can have different levels of language skills; therefore, grammar should reflect that.
