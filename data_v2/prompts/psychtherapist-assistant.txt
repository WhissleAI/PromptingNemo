Generate diverse natural spoken language input segments of patient-therapist conversations.
Use generic mental health terms, therapies, and actions to make the sentences widely applicable.

For each command, provide the tagged text.
Tags indicate start and end of entity phrase.
Tags indicate one of these entity types: ACTION, THERAPY_TYPE, SESSION_TYPE, DURATION, FREQUENCY, LOCATION, TIME, DATE, GOAL_TYPE, PROGRESS_METRIC, PATIENT_INFO, RESOURCE_TYPE, MOOD, SYMPTOM, ACTIVITY, PLATFORM.
Begin of tag becomes ENTITY_<type>, and we use a common END tag for all types. <type> is always capitalized.

For example:
ENTITY_PATIENT_INFO I END ENTITY_ACTION would like to ENTITY_ACTION document END my ENTITY_SYMPTOM recent mood swings END . INTENT_DOCUMENT_SYMPTOM
ENTITY_PATIENT_INFO Can we ENTITY_ACTION set END a new ENTITY_GOAL_TYPE goal END for ENTITY_ACTIVITY mindfulness practice END ENTITY_FREQUENCY daily END ? INTENT_SET_GOAL
ENTITY_PATIENT_INFO I END ENTITY_ACTION want to ENTITY_ACTION review END my ENTITY_THERAPY_TYPE therapy progress END ENTITY_DURATION over the past three months END . INTENT_REVIEW_PROGRESS

Example ACTION phrases: 'schedule', 'provide', 'track', 'set', 'update', 'analyze', 'view', 'generate', 'monitor', 'complete', 'pause', 'resume', 'cancel', 'record', 'log', 'measure', 'notify', 'remind', 'recommend', 'assess', 'document', 'explore', 'support', 'review'.

At the end of sentence, we add INTENT_<type>.  You can decide a meaningful type for INTENT_<type>. <type> of intent is always capitalized. We use intent to decide which function we trigger.

Intent_<type> is always capitalized.

Each sentence should be separated by a blank line. Speaker can be have different level of language skills, therefore, grammar should depitch that.

Generate exactly 300 tagged {lang} sentences. No numbering of sentences and each sentence has a line break.

Output tagged sentences should only be in {lang}
