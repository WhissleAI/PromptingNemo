Generate diverse natural language transcription segments of soccer match commentary. Use generic soccer terms, match details, and actions to make the sentences widely applicable. Sentences should have nuances like real soccer commentary, including jokes, discussions, and casual remarks.

For each segment, provide the tagged text. Tags indicate the start and end of the entity phrase. Tags indicate one of these entity types: ACTION, MATCH_TYPE, TEAM_NAME, PLAYER_NAME, STATISTIC_TYPE, HIGHLIGHT_TYPE, DURATION, FREQUENCY, TIME, DATE, EVENT, SCORE, LOCATION, LEAGUE_NAME, SEASON, COMMENT, USER_INFO, COMMAND, ANALYSIS_TYPE, REFEREE_NAME, ASSISTANT_REFEREE_NAME, GOALKEEPER_NAME, FAN_REACTION, COACH_NAME, SUBSTITUTION_REASON, INJURY_TYPE, WEATHER_CONDITION, STADIUM_NAME, CROWD_SIZE, PENALTY_TYPE, OFFSIDE_DECISION, VAR_DECISION.

Begin the tag with ENTITY_<type>, and use a common END tag for all types. <type> is always capitalized.

For example:
ENTITY_PLAYER_NAME Neymar END ENTITY_ACTION sets up END a perfect goal for ENTITY_TEAM_NAME PSG END in the ENTITY_MATCH_TYPE Champions League END ENTITY_DATE quarterfinals END. INTENT_HIGHLIGHT
ENTITY_TEAM_NAME Liverpool END ENTITY_ACTION wins END the ENTITY_MATCH_TYPE Champions League END after a ENTITY_SCORE 2-0 END victory over ENTITY_TEAM_NAME Tottenham Hotspur END. INTENT_RESULT
ENTITY_PLAYER_NAME Suarez END ENTITY_ACTION bites END ENTITY_PLAYER_NAME Chiellini END in the ENTITY_MATCH_TYPE World Cup END ENTITY_DATE 2014 END. INTENT_FOUL
And it's a brilliant ENTITY_ACTION save END! ENTITY_GOALKEEPER_NAME De Gea END diving to his left. INTENT_SAVE
What a ENTITY_ACTION pass END from ENTITY_PLAYER_NAME Modric END, absolutely world-class! INTENT_PASS
ENTITY_REFEREE_NAME Mike Dean END ENTITY_ACTION gives END a ENTITY_PENALTY_TYPE yellow card END to ENTITY_PLAYER_NAME Ramos END. INTENT_DECISION
The ENTITY_WEATHER_CONDITION rain END is making the pitch slippery. INTENT_COMMENT
ENTITY_COACH_NAME Klopp END looks frustrated on the sidelines. INTENT_COMMENT

Example ACTION phrases: 'scores', 'passes', 'heads', 'dominates', 'sets up', 'saves', 'tackles', 'shoots', 'crosses', 'defends', 'dribbles', 'assists', 'fouls', 'wins', 'loses', 'draws', 'equalizes', 'substitutes', 'injures', 'recovers', 'celebrates', 'signals', 'whistles', 'checks', 'reviews', 'announces'.

At the end of each sentence, we add INTENT_<type>. You can decide a meaningful type for INTENT_<type>. <type> of intent is always capitalized. We use intent to decide which function we trigger.

Intent_<type> is always capitalized.

Each sentence should be separated by a blank line. Sentences should show many different parts of soccer match commentary, not just highlights.

Generate exactly 300 tagged {lang} sentences. No numbering of sentences and each sentence has a line break.

Output tagged sentences should only be in {lang}.
