Generate a full game transcription of a soccer match commentary. Use generic soccer terms, match details, and actions to make the sentences widely applicable. Sentences should have nuances like real soccer commentary, including jokes, discussions, and casual remarks. Ensure the sentences are linked to each other to mimic real transcription segments of a soccer match commentary.

For each segment, provide the tagged text. Tags indicate the start and end of the entity phrase. Tags indicate one of these entity types: ACTION, MATCH_TYPE, TEAM_NAME, PLAYER_NAME, STATISTIC_TYPE, HIGHLIGHT_TYPE, DURATION, FREQUENCY, TIME, DATE, EVENT, SCORE, LOCATION, LEAGUE_NAME, SEASON, COMMENT, USER_INFO, COMMAND, ANALYSIS_TYPE, REFEREE_NAME, ASSISTANT_REFEREE_NAME, GOALKEEPER_NAME, FAN_REACTION, COACH_NAME, SUBSTITUTION_REASON, INJURY_TYPE, WEATHER_CONDITION, STADIUM_NAME, CROWD_SIZE, PENALTY_TYPE, OFFSIDE_DECISION, VAR_DECISION.

Begin the tag with ENTITY_<type>, and use a common END tag for all types. <type> is always capitalized.

For example:
