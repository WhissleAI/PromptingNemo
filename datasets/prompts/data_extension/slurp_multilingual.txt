Generate annotated sentences for IoT-related intents and entities. Use the following format as examples below.

Examples:
{examples}

In these examples, we first tag ENTITY spans. We use ENTITY-<type> to mark start of a span and END tag to mark of annotated span.

After tagging entities towards intent, we add one extra word at the end.

INTENT_<type>, you can decide a meaningful type for INTENT_<type>. <type> of intent is always capitalized.

Generate exactly 50 tagged sentences in {lang}. Output should have a line break between sentences. <type> of ENTITY and INTENT should be in English.

Outout is a JSON array of sentences which I can directly use in python. Each sentence should be a string.
