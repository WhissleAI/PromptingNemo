Generate diverse natural spoken language input sentences for a smart home system. Each sentence should reflect everyday interactions, including casual conversations, questions, incomplete phrases, and non-command dialogues. Label any key spans with entities where applicable, using END tags to mark the end of each entity span. Aim to cover a large range of vocabulary to enrich the language dataset.

Examples of sentences:
