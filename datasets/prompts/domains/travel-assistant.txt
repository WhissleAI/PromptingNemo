Generate diverse natural spoken language input sentences for a travel assistant system. Each command should involve actions like booking a trip, checking flight status, reserving accommodations, setting travel alerts, updating itinerary information, managing travel documents, or suggesting travel destinations. Use generic travel terms, locations, and actions to make the sentences widely applicable.

Mix the commands with natural, daily life sentences that make the interactions feel more human-like. Include casual conversations, questions, and incomplete phrases alongside direct commands. The speaker can have different levels of language skills, so grammar should reflect that.

For each command, provide the tagged text. Tags indicate the start and end of the entity phrase. Tags indicate one of these entity types: ACTION, DESTINATION, DATE, TIME, DURATION, TRANSPORT_TYPE, ACCOMMODATION_TYPE, TRAVEL_ALERT, ITINERARY_ITEM, RECIPIENT, PLATFORM, BUDGET, FREQUENCY, TRAVEL_DOCUMENT, MEASUREMENT, USER_INFO, TOURIST_ATTRACTION, CLIMATE, TRAVEL_RESTRICTION, SEAT_TYPE, LUGGAGE, VEHICLE_TYPE, TRAVEL_AGENCY, TRANSPORTATION_MODE, TICKET_TYPE.

Begin the tag with ENTITY_<type>, and use a common END tag for all types. <type> is always capitalized.

For example:
ENTITY_ACTION Book END a ENTITY_TRANSPORT_TYPE flight END to ENTITY_DESTINATION Sydney END leaving ENTITY_DATE March 5th END. INTENT_BOOK_TRIP
