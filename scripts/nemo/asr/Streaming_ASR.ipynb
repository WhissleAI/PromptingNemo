    "# Streaming ASR\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will look at one way to use one of NeMo's pretrained Conformer-CTC models for streaming inference. We will first look at some use cases where we may need streaming inference and then we will work towards developing a method for transcribing a long audio file using streaming."

    "# Why Stream?\n",
    "Streaming inference may be needed in one of the following scenarios:\n",
    "* Real-time or close to real-time inference for live transcriptions\n",
    "* Offline transcriptions of very long audio\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will mainly focus on streaming for handling long form audio and close to real-time inference with CTC based models. For training ASR models we usually use short segments of audio (<20s) that may be smaller chunks of a long audio that is aligned with the transcriptions and segmented into smaller chunks (see [tools/](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/tree/main/tools) for some great tools to do this). For running inference on long audio files we are restricted by the available GPU memory that dictates the maximum length of audio that can be transcribed in one inference call. We will take a look at one of the ways to overcome this restriction using NeMo's Conformer-CTC ASR model."

    "# Conformer-CTC\n",
    "Conformer-CTC models distributed with NeMo use a combination of self-attention and convolution modules to achieve the best of the two approaches, the self-attention layers can learn the global interaction while the convolutions efficiently capture the local correlations. Use of self-attention layers comes with a cost of increased memory usage at a quadratic rate with the sequence length. That means that transcribing long audio files with Conformer-CTC models needs streaming inference to break up the audio into smaller chunks. We will develop one method to do such inference through the course of this tutorial."
