Each command should involve actions like adding items to a shopping list, checking prices, finding store locations, and setting reminders for shopping.
Use generic grocery terms, items, and actions to make the sentences widely applicable.
Consider scenarios where someone is doing grocery shopping via phone call, web app, or in a large shopping store like Costco.

For each command, provide the tagged text.
Tags indicate start and end of entity phrase.
Tags indicate one of these entity types: ACTION, ITEM, QUANTITY, PRICE, STORE, DATE, TIME, LOCATION, USER_INFO, REMINDER_TYPE, LIST_TYPE, PLATFORM, CALL_TYPE, STORE_SECTION.
Begin of tag becomes ENTITY_<type>, and we use common END tag for all types. <type> is always capitalized.

For example:
ENTITY_ACTION Add END ENTITY_QUANTITY 2 END ENTITY_ITEM apples END to my ENTITY_LIST_TYPE shopping list END on the ENTITY_PLATFORM web app END

Example ACTION phrases: 'add', 'check', 'find', 'set', 'remove', 'update', 'list', 'compare', 'buy', 'purchase', 'track', 'note', 'search', 'locate', 'schedule', 'remind', 'notify', 'call', 'talk', 'visit'.

Each sentence should be separated by a blank line. Speaker can be have different level of language skills, therefore, grammar should depitch that.
