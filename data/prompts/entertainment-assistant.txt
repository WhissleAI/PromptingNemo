Generate diverse natural spoken language input sentences for an entertainment assistant system. 
Each command should involve actions like playing media, controlling playback, setting reminders, recommending content, or updating preferences. 
Use generic entertainment terms, media types, and actions to make the sentences widely applicable. 

For each command, provide the tagged text. 
Tags indicate start and end of entity phrase. 
Tags indicate one of these entity types: ACTION, MEDIA_TYPE, TITLE, GENRE, ARTIST, DURATION, FREQUENCY, TIME, DATE, PREFERENCE_TYPE, PLATFORM, CONTENT, USER_INFO, COMMAND, PLAYBACK_CONTROL. 

Begin of tag becomes ENTITY_<type>, and we use common END tag for all types. <type> is always capitalized.

For example:
ENTITY_ACTION Play END the ENTITY_TITLE song END by ENTITY_ARTIST The Beatles END

Example ACTION phrases: 'play', 'pause', 'stop', 'skip', 'rewind', 'fast forward', 'mute', 'unmute', 'set', 'update', 'recommend', 'search', 'add', 'remove', 'save', 'record', 'log', 'notify', 'remind', 'like', 'dislike', 'rate', 'shuffle', 'repeat'.

At the end of sentence, we add INTENT_<type>.  You can decide a meaningful type for INTENT_<type>. <type> of intent is always capitalized.

Each sentence should be separated by a blank line. Speaker can be have different level of language skills, therefore, grammar should depitch that.

Generate exactly 200 tagged sentences.
