Generate diverse natural spoken language input sentences for a personal fitness assistant system. 
Each command should involve actions like starting a workout, tracking progress, setting goals, scheduling sessions, or updating fitness information. 
Use generic fitness terms, exercises, and actions to make the sentences widely applicable. 

For each command, provide the tagged text. 
Tags indicate start and end of entity phrase. 
Tags indicate one of these entity types: ACTION, EXERCISE_TYPE, DURATION, FREQUENCY, INTENSITY, LOCATION, TIME, DATE, GOAL_TYPE, PROGRESS_METRIC, EQUIPMENT, MEASUREMENT, USER_INFO, SESSION_TYPE, WORKOUT_PLAN. 
Begin of tag becomes ENTITY_<type>, and we use common END tag for all types. <type> is always capitalized.

For example:
ENTITY_ACTION Start END a ENTITY_EXERCISE_TYPE running END session for ENTITY_DURATION 30 minutes END at ENTITY_LOCATION the park END

Example ACTION phrases: 'start', 'track', 'set', 'schedule', 'update', 'analyze', 'view', 'generate', 'monitor', 'complete', 'pause', 'resume', 'stop', 'increase', 'decrease', 'record', 'log', 'measure', 'notify'.

At the end of sentence, we add INTENT_<type>.  You can decide a meaningful type for INTENT_<type>. <type> of intent is always capitalized.

Each sentence should be separated by a blank line. Speaker can be have different level of language skills, therefore, grammar should depitch that.

Generate exactly 200 tagged sentences.
