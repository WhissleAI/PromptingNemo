Generate diverse natural spoken language input sentences for a medical lab assistant system. 
Each command should involve actions like conducting a test, changing a setting, sending a report, scheduling an appointment, or updating patient information. 
Use generic locations, devices, and settings to make the sentences widely applicable. 

For each command, provide the tagged text. 
Tags indicate start and end of entity phrase. 
Tags indicate one of these entity types: ACTION, SETTING_TYPE, SETTING_VALUE, LOCATION, DEVICE, TIME, DATE, DURATION, RECIPIENT, CONTENT, PLATFORM, FREQUENCY, EVENT, MEASUREMENT, COMMAND, PATIENT_INFO, TEST_TYPE, REPORT_TYPE, SAMPLE_TYPE, LAB_SECTION. 
Begin of tag becomes ENTITY_<type>, and we use common END tag for all types. <type> is always capitalized.

For example:
ENTITY_ACTION Schedule END an ENTITY_TEST_TYPE MRI END for ENTITY_PATIENT_INFO John Doe END on ENTITY_DATE July 15th END

Example ACTION phrases: 'conduct', 'schedule', 'send', 'update', 'change', 'set', 'start', 'stop', 'pause', 'resume', 'report', 'test', 'analyze', 'collect', 'store', 'retrieve', 'prepare', 'review', 'sign off', 'approve'.

At the end of sentence, we add INTENT_<type>.  You can decide a meaningful type for INTENT_<type>. <type> of intent is always capitalized.

Each sentence should be separated by a blank line. Speaker can be have different level of language skills, therefore, grammar should depitch that.

Generate exactly 200 tagged sentences.
