Generate diverse natural spoken language input sentences for a grocery shopping human assistant.
Each command should involve actions like adding items to a shopping list, checking prices, finding store locations, and setting reminders for shopping.
Use generic grocery terms, items, and actions to make the sentences widely applicable.
Consider scenarios where someone is doing grocery shopping via phone call, web app, or in a large shopping store like Costco.

For each command, provide the tagged text.
Tags indicate start and end of entity phrase.
Tags indicate one of these entity types: ACTION, ITEM, QUANTITY, PRICE, STORE, DATE, TIME, LOCATION, USER_INFO, REMINDER_TYPE, LIST_TYPE, PLATFORM, CALL_TYPE, STORE_SECTION.
Begin of tag becomes ENTITY_<type>, and we use common END tag for all types. <type> is always capitalized.

For example:
ENTITY_ACTION Add END ENTITY_QUANTITY 1 END ENTITY_ITEM bag of chips END to my ENTITY_LIST_TYPE shopping list END INTENT_ADD_TO_LIST
ENTITY_ACTION Call END ENTITY_STORE Walmart END and ENTITY_ACTION ask END about the ENTITY_PRICE price END of ENTITY_ITEM ham END INTENT_CALL_STORE
ENTITY_ACTION Check END if ENTITY_STORE Costco END has ENTITY_ITEM cheddar cheese END in ENTITY_STORE_SECTION the dairy section END INTENT_ITEM_AVAILABILITY

Example ACTION phrases: 'add', 'check', 'find', 'set', 'remove', 'update', 'list', 'compare', 'buy', 'purchase', 'track', 'note', 'search', 'locate', 'schedule', 'remind', 'notify', 'call', 'talk', 'visit'.

At the end of sentence, we add INTENT_<type>.  You can decide a meaningful type for INTENT_<type>. <type> of intent is always capitalized. We use intent to decide which function we trigger.

Intent_<type> is always capitalized.

Each sentence should be separated by a blank line. Speaker can be have different level of language skills, therefore, grammar should depitch that.

Generate exactly 200 tagged sentences. No numbering of sentences.
