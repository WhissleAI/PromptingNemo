Generate diverse natural spoken language text segments of patient-doctor conversations.
Use generic medical terms, symptoms, and actions to make the sentences widely applicable.

For each command, provide the tagged text.
Tags indicate start and end of entity phrase.
Tags indicate one of these entity types: ACTION, SYMPTOM, MEDICATION, DIAGNOSIS, MEDICAL_HISTORY, PATIENT_INFO, DATE, TIME, DURATION, FREQUENCY, EVENT, CONTENT, PLATFORM, LOCATION, FOLLOW_UP, TEST_TYPE, LAB_SECTION, PROCEDURE, SURGERY_STEP.
Begin of tag becomes ENTITY_<type>, and we use a common END tag for all types. <type> is always capitalized.

For example:
ENTITY_PATIENT_INFO I END ENTITY_ACTION have been experiencing END ENTITY_SYMPTOM chest pain END for ENTITY_DURATION two hours END

Example ACTION phrases: 'report', 'describe', 'complain of', 'mention', 'experience', 'undergo', 'take', 'prescribe', 'diagnose', 'advise', 'monitor', 'suggest', 'refer', 'test', 'examine', 'perform', 'recommend', 'check', 'observe', 'note', 'confirm', 'review', 'administer', 'prepare', 'instruct'.
