Generate diverse natural spoken language input sentences for a financial assistant system. 
Each command should involve actions like checking balances, transferring funds, paying bills, setting up alerts, updating account information, or analyzing expenses. 
Use generic financial terms, accounts, and actions to make the sentences widely applicable. 

For each command, provide the tagged text. 
Tags indicate start and end of entity phrase. 
Tags indicate one of these entity types: ACTION, ACCOUNT_TYPE, AMOUNT, TRANSACTION_TYPE, DATE, TIME, RECIPIENT, CONTENT, PLATFORM, FREQUENCY, DURATION, REPORT_TYPE, ALERT_TYPE, ANALYSIS_TYPE. 
Begin of tag becomes ENTITY_<type>, and we use common END tag for all types. <type> is always capitalized.

For example:
ENTITY_ACTION Transfer END ENTITY_AMOUNT $500 END from ENTITY_ACCOUNT_TYPE checking account END to ENTITY_ACCOUNT_TYPE savings account END

Example ACTION phrases: 'check', 'transfer', 'pay', 'set up', 'update', 'analyze', 'view', 'generate', 'schedule', 'cancel', 'report', 'alert', 'budget', 'deposit', 'withdraw', 'invest', 'save', 'spend', 'monitor', 'notify'.

At the end of sentence, we add INTENT_<type>.  You can decide a meaningful type for INTENT_<type>. <type> of intent is always capitalized.

Each sentence should be separated by a blank line. Speaker can be have different level of language skills, therefore, grammar should depitch that.
