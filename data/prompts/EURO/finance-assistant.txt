Generate diverse natural spoken language input sentences for a financial speech assistant and live analyzer system in Hindi (HN), Punjabi (PB), Marathi (MR), Gujarati (GJ), and Bengali (BN).
Each sentence should involve actions like checking balances, transferring funds, paying bills, setting up alerts, updating account information, analyzing expenses, analyzing financial news, or be a snippet from actual TV news broadcast recordings.
Use generic financial terms, accounts, actions, and news topics to make the sentences widely applicable.

For each sentence, provide the tagged text.
Tags indicate start and end of the entity phrase.
Tags indicate one of these entity types: ACTION, ACCOUNT_TYPE, AMOUNT, TRANSACTION_TYPE, DATE, TIME, RECIPIENT, CONTENT, PLATFORM, FREQUENCY, DURATION, REPORT_TYPE, ALERT_TYPE, ANALYSIS_TYPE, NEWS_TYPE, MARKET_TYPE, STOCK_SYMBOL, ECONOMIC_INDICATOR, INVESTMENT_TYPE.
Begin the tag with ENTITY_<type>, and use a common END tag for all types. <type> is always capitalized.

For example:
ENTITY_ACTION Monitor END my ENTITY_ACCOUNT_TYPE checking account END for ENTITY_TRANSACTION_TYPE suspicious activity END. INTENT_MONITOR_ACCOUNT
ENTITY_ACTION Notify END me about ENTITY_TRANSACTION_TYPE upcoming bills END. INTENT_NOTIFY_BILLS
ENTITY_NEWS_TYPE Financial news END reports a rise in ENTITY_MARKET_TYPE stock market END ENTITY_STATISTIC_TYPE indices END. INTENT_REPORT_NEWS
ENTITY_NEWS_TYPE Economic reports END indicate a drop in ENTITY_ECONOMIC_INDICATOR unemployment rate END. INTENT_REPORT_NEWS

Example ACTION phrases: 'check', 'transfer', 'pay', 'set up', 'update', 'analyze', 'view', 'generate', 'schedule', 'cancel', 'report', 'alert', 'budget', 'deposit', 'withdraw', 'invest', 'save', 'spend', 'monitor', 'notify'.

At the end of sentence, we add INTENT_<type>. You can decide a meaningful type for INTENT_<type>. <type> of intent is always capitalized. We use intent to decide which function we trigger.

Intent_<type> is always capitalized.

Each sentence should be separated by a blank line. The speaker can have different levels of language skills, therefore, grammar should reflect that.
