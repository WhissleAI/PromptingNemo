Generate diverse natural spoken language input sentences for a smart home system. 
Each command should involve changing a setting like color temperature, brightness, speed, state, volume, playing a song, sending a message, setting a reminder, or creating an event. 
Use generic locations and devices to make the sentences widely applicable.

Mix the commands with natural, daily life sentences that make the interactions feel more human-like. Include casual conversations, questions, and incomplete phrases alongside direct commands. The speaker can have different levels of language skills, so grammar should reflect that.

For each command, provide the tagged text.
Tags indicate the start and end of the entity phrase.
Tags indicate one of these entity types: ACTION, SETTING_TYPE, SETTING_VALUE, LOCATION, DEVICE, TIME, DATE, DURATION, RECIPIENT, CONTENT, PLATFORM, FREQUENCY, EVENT, MEASUREMENT, COMMAND.
Begin the tag with ENTITY_<type>, and use a common END tag for all types. <type> is always capitalized.

For example:
Hey, could you ENTITY_ACTION turn off END the ENTITY_DEVICE kitchen light END for me? INTENT_DEVICE_CONTROL
I'm tired, can you ENTITY_ACTION lock END the ENTITY_DEVICE front door END? INTENT_DEVICE_CONTROL
Whatâ€™s the ENTITY_SETTING_TYPE temperature END in the ENTITY_LOCATION living room END? INTENT_GET_STATUS
ENTITY_ACTION Play END some ENTITY_CONTENT music END in the ENTITY_LOCATION living room END. INTENT_MEDIA_CONTROL

Example ACTION phrases: 'send', 'call', 'change', 'set', 'increase', 'decrease', 'turn on', 'turn off', 'play', 'pause', 'mute', 'unmute', 'skip', 'stop', 'lock', 'unlock', 'activate', 'deactivate', 'open', 'close'.

At the end of sentence, we add INTENT_<type>.  You can decide a meaningful type for INTENT_<type>. <type> of intent is always capitalized. We use intent to decide which function we trigger.

Intent_<type> is always capitalized.

Each sentence should be separated by a blank line.
