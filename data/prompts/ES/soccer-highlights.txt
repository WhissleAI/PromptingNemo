Generate diverse natural language transcription segments of soccer match commentary.
Use generic soccer terms, match details, and actions to make the sentences widely applicable.
Sentences should have naunances like a real soccer commentary, including jokes, discussions.
For each command, provide the tagged text.
Tags indicate start and end of entity phrase.
Tags indicate one of these entity types: ACTION, MATCH_TYPE, TEAM_NAME, PLAYER_NAME, STATISTIC_TYPE, HIGHLIGHT_TYPE, DURATION, FREQUENCY, TIME, DATE, EVENT, SCORE, LOCATION, LEAGUE_NAME, SEASON, COMMENT, USER_INFO, COMMAND, ANALYSIS_TYPE.
Begin of tag becomes ENTITY_<type>, and we use a common END tag for all types. <type> is always capitalized.

For example:
ENTITY_PLAYER_NAME Neymar END ENTITY_ACTION sets up END a perfect goal for ENTITY_TEAM_NAME PSG END in the ENTITY_MATCH_TYPE Champions League END ENTITY_DATE quarterfinals END . INTENT_HIGHLIGHT
ENTITY_TEAM_NAME Liverpool END ENTITY_ACTION wins END the ENTITY_MATCH_TYPE Champions League END after a ENTITY_SCORE 2-0 END victory over ENTITY_TEAM_NAME Tottenham Hotspur END . INTENT_RESULT
ENTITY_PLAYER_NAME Suarez END ENTITY_ACTION bites END ENTITY_PLAYER_NAME Chiellini END in the ENTITY_MATCH_TYPE World Cup END ENTITY_DATE 2014 END. INTENT_FOUL"
And it's a brilliant ENTITY_ACTION save END! ENTITY_PLAYER_NAME De Gea END diving to his left. INTENT_SAVE
What a ENTITY_ACTION pass END from ENTITY_PLAYER_NAME Modric END, absolutely world-class! INTENT_PASS

Example ACTION phrases: 'scores', 'passes', 'heads', 'dominates', 'sets up', 'saves', 'tackles', 'shoots', 'crosses', 'defends', 'dribbles', 'assists', 'fouls', 'wins', 'loses', 'draws', 'equalizes', 'substitutes', 'injures', 'recovers', 'celebrates'.

At the end of sentence, we add INTENT_<type>.  You can decide a meaningful type for INTENT_<type>. <type> of intent is always capitalized. We use intent to decide which function we trigger.

Intent_<type> is always capitalized.

Each sentence should be separated by a blank line. Sentence show many different parts of a soccer match commentary, not just highlights
