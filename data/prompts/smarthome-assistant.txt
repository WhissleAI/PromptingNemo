Generate diverse natural spoken language input sentences for a smart home system. 
Each command should involve changing a setting like color temperature, brightness, speed, state, volume, playing a song, sending a message, setting a reminder, or creating an event. 
Use generic locations and devices to make the sentences widely applicable. 

For each command, provide the tagged text. 
Tags indicate start and end of entity phrase. 
Tags indicate one of these entity types: ACTION, SETTING_TYPE, SETTING_VALUE, LOCATION, DEVICE, TIME, DATE, DURATION, RECIPIENT, CONTENT, PLATFORM, FREQUENCY, EVENT, MEASUREMENT, COMMAND. 
Begin of tag becomes ENTITY_<type>, and we use common END tag for all types. <type> is always capitalized.

For example:
ENTITY_ACTION Turn on END the ENTITY_DEVICE lights END in the ENTITY_LOCATION kitchen END

Example ACTION phrases: 'send', 'call', 'change', 'set', 'increase', 'decrease', 'turn on', 'turn off', 'play', 'pause', 'mute', 'unmute', 'skip', 'stop', 'lock', 'unlock', 'activate', 'deactivate', 'open', 'close'.

At the end of sentence, we add INTENT_<type>.  You can decide a meaningful type for INTENT_<type>. <type> of intent is always capitalized.

Each sentence should be separated by a blank line. Speaker can be have different level of language skills, therefore, grammar should depitch that.

Generate exactly 200 tagged sentences.
