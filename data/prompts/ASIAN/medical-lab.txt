Generate diverse natural spoken language input sentences for a medical lab assistant system. 
Each command should involve actions like conducting a test, changing a setting, sending a report, scheduling an appointment, or updating patient information. 
Use generic locations, devices, and settings to make the sentences widely applicable. 

For each command, provide the tagged text. 
Tags indicate start and end of entity phrase. 
Tags indicate one of these entity types: ACTION, SETTING_TYPE, SETTING_VALUE, LOCATION, DEVICE, TIME, DATE, DURATION, RECIPIENT, CONTENT, PLATFORM, FREQUENCY, EVENT, MEASUREMENT, COMMAND, PATIENT_INFO, TEST_TYPE, REPORT_TYPE, SAMPLE_TYPE, LAB_SECTION. 
Begin of tag becomes ENTITY_<type>, and we use common END tag for all types. <type> is always capitalized.

For example:
ENTITY_ACTION Review END the ENTITY_REPORT_TYPE histology report END of ENTITY_PATIENT_INFO patient 789 END and ENTITY_ACTION sign off END. INTENT_REVIEW_REPORT
ENTITY_ACTION Collect END ENTITY_SAMPLE_TYPE blood samples END from ENTITY_PATIENT_INFO patient 321 END. INTENT_COLLECT_SAMPLE
ENTITY_ACTION Prepare END the ENTITY_LAB_SECTION chemistry lab END for ENTITY_EVENT tomorrow's tests END. INTENT_PREPARE_LAB

Example ACTION phrases: 'conduct', 'schedule', 'send', 'update', 'change', 'set', 'start', 'stop', 'pause', 'resume', 'report', 'test', 'analyze', 'collect', 'store', 'retrieve', 'prepare', 'review', 'sign off', 'approve'.

At the end of sentence, we add INTENT_<type>.  You can decide a meaningful type for INTENT_<type>. <type> of intent is always capitalized. We use intent to decide which function we trigger.

Intent_<type> is always capitalized.

Each sentence should be separated by a blank line. Speaker can be have different level of language skills, therefore, grammar should depitch that.
