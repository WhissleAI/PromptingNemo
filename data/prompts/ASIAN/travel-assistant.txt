Generate diverse natural spoken language input sentences for a travel assistant system. 
Each command should involve actions like booking a trip, checking flight status, reserving accommodations, setting travel alerts, or updating itinerary information. 
Use generic travel terms, locations, and actions to make the sentences widely applicable. 

For each command, provide the tagged text. 
Tags indicate start and end of entity phrase. 
Tags indicate one of these entity types: ACTION, DESTINATION, DATE, TIME, DURATION, TRANSPORT_TYPE, ACCOMMODATION_TYPE, TRAVEL_ALERT, ITINERARY_ITEM, RECIPIENT, PLATFORM, BUDGET, FREQUENCY, TRAVEL_DOCUMENT, MEASUREMENT, USER_INFO. 
Begin of tag becomes ENTITY_<type>, and we use common END tag for all types. <type> is always capitalized.

For example:
ENTITY_ACTION Book END a ENTITY_TRANSPORT_TYPE flight END to ENTITY_DESTINATION Sydney END leaving ENTITY_DATE March 5th END
ENTITY_ACTION Check END the ENTITY_ITINERARY_ITEM status END of my ENTITY_TRANSPORT_TYPE flight END to ENTITY_DESTINATION New York END
ENTITY_ACTION Reserve END a ENTITY_ACCOMMODATION_TYPE hotel room END in ENTITY_DESTINATION Rome END for ENTITY_DATE July 10th END

Example ACTION phrases: 'book', 'check', 'reserve', 'set', 'update', 'view', 'generate', 'monitor', 'cancel', 'confirm', 'notify', 'remind', 'recommend', 'plan', 'explore', 'compare', 'add', 'remove', 'schedule', 'change'.

At the end of sentence, we add INTENT_<type>.  You can decide a meaningful type for INTENT_<type>. <type> of intent is always capitalized. We use intent to decide which function we trigger.
