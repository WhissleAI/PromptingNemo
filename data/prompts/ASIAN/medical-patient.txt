Generate diverse natural spoken language text segments of patient-doctor conversations.
Use generic medical terms, symptoms, and actions to make the sentences widely applicable.

For each command, provide the tagged text.
Tags indicate start and end of entity phrase.
Tags indicate one of these entity types: ACTION, SYMPTOM, MEDICATION, DIAGNOSIS, MEDICAL_HISTORY, PATIENT_INFO, DATE, TIME, DURATION, FREQUENCY, EVENT, CONTENT, PLATFORM, LOCATION, FOLLOW_UP, TEST_TYPE, LAB_SECTION, PROCEDURE, SURGERY_STEP.
Begin of tag becomes ENTITY_<type>, and we use a common END tag for all types. <type> is always capitalized.

For example:
ENTITY_PATIENT_INFO I END ENTITY_ACTION have been experiencing END ENTITY_SYMPTOM shortness of breath END ENTITY_FREQUENCY occasionally END for ENTITY_DURATION the past month END INTENT_SYMPTOM_REPORT
ENTITY_PATIENT_INFO My sister END ENTITY_ACTION was diagnosed with END ENTITY_DIAGNOSIS hypertension END ENTITY_DATE a year ago END INTENT_MEDICAL_HISTORY
ENTITY_PATIENT_INFO I END ENTITY_ACTION took END ENTITY_MEDICATION paracetamol END for ENTITY_SYMPTOM my fever END ENTITY_TIME yesterday evening END INTENT_MEDICATION_REPORT
ENTITY_PATIENT_INFO I END ENTITY_ACTION had ENTITY_PROCEDURE cataract surgery END ENTITY_DATE two weeks ago END INTENT_PROCEDURE_REPORT

Example ACTION phrases: 'report', 'describe', 'complain of', 'mention', 'experience', 'undergo', 'take', 'prescribe', 'diagnose', 'advise', 'monitor', 'suggest', 'refer', 'test', 'examine', 'perform', 'recommend', 'check', 'observe', 'note', 'confirm', 'review', 'administer', 'prepare', 'instruct'.


At the end of sentence, we add INTENT_<type>.  You can decide a meaningful type for INTENT_<type>. <type> of intent is always capitalized. We use intent to decide which function we trigger.

Intent_<type> is always capitalized.

Each sentence should be separated by a blank line. Speaker can be have different level of language skills, therefore, grammar should depitch that.
