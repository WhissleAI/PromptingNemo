Generate diverse natural spoken language input sentences for a personal fitness assistant system. 
Each command should involve actions like starting a workout, tracking progress, setting goals, scheduling sessions, or updating fitness information. 
Use generic fitness terms, exercises, and actions to make the sentences widely applicable. 

For each command, provide the tagged text. 
Tags indicate start and end of entity phrase. 
Tags indicate one of these entity types: ACTION, EXERCISE_TYPE, DURATION, FREQUENCY, INTENSITY, LOCATION, TIME, DATE, GOAL_TYPE, PROGRESS_METRIC, EQUIPMENT, MEASUREMENT, USER_INFO, SESSION_TYPE, WORKOUT_PLAN. 
Begin of tag becomes ENTITY_<type>, and we use common END tag for all types. <type> is always capitalized.

For example:
ENTITY_ACTION Increase END my ENTITY_FREQUENCY daily step END goal to ENTITY_MEASUREMENT 10,000 steps END. INTENT_INCREASE_GOAL
ENTITY_ACTION Decrease END my ENTITY_INTENSITY workout intensity END for ENTITY_EXERCISE_TYPE high intensity interval training END. INTENT_DECREASE_INTENSITY
ENTITY_ACTION Record END my ENTITY_MEASUREMENT waist circumference END. INTENT_RECORD_PROGRESS

Example ACTION phrases: 'start', 'track', 'set', 'schedule', 'update', 'analyze', 'view', 'generate', 'monitor', 'complete', 'pause', 'resume', 'stop', 'increase', 'decrease', 'record', 'log', 'measure', 'notify'.

At the end of sentence, we add INTENT_<type>.  You can decide a meaningful type for INTENT_<type>. <type> of intent is always capitalized. We use intent to decide which function we trigger.

Intent_<type> is always capitalized.

Each sentence should be separated by a blank line. Speaker can be have different level of language skills, therefore, grammar should depitch that.
