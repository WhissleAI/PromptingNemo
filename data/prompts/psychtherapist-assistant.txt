Generate diverse natural spoken language input segments of patient-therapist conversations.
Use generic mental health terms, therapies, and actions to make the sentences widely applicable.

Tags indicate one of these entity types: ACTION, THERAPY_TYPE, SESSION_TYPE, DURATION, FREQUENCY, LOCATION, TIME, DATE, GOAL_TYPE, PROGRESS_METRIC, PATIENT_INFO, RESOURCE_TYPE, MOOD, SYMPTOM, ACTIVITY, PLATFORM.
Begin of tag becomes ENTITY_<type>, and we use a common END tag for all types. <type> is always capitalized.
